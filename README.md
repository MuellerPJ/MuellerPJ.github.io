# Portfolio
In this repository, I'll be adding some of my data science projects over time under the pretense that I found the project itself interesting and am generally happy with how clean the code and commenting are.

## Project 1: Heatmap for Peak Foot Pressure Values
[notebook](https://github.com/MuellerPJ/MuellerPJ.github.io/blob/0a704907a47fde2b5e421d9da41f12edfafe5898/notebooks/Heatmap_Foot_Pressure.ipynb)  [nbviewer](https://nbviewer.org/github/MuellerPJ/MuellerPJ.github.io/blob/main/notebooks/Heatmap_Foot_Pressure.ipynb)<br>
As part of my masterâ€™s thesis, I created heatmaps of the average maximum pressure values of the foot during running across multiple subjects at the same speed and wearing the same shoes. This notebook demonstrates the process using one of the speed/shoe combinations. 
Key steps include:
* Dynamic Separator Detection
* Data Preprocessing with Pandas
* Interpolation with SciPy
* Data Visualization with Matplotlib
